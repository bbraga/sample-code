This package contains some sample applications I did for a former client in order to be accepted as their employee, it is in no way copyrighted by them.

Please review the phptext.pdf for the exercises in the set.

As a bonus I also did one final test exercise that consisted in:

	A simple book store consisting of two pages:
   		- Add/edit book
   		- Search for book by: ISBN or title (empty search will show all books).
   		- A page that will auto-fill the db by parsing books from: http://www.valorebooks.com/top-textbooks 
		- you do not need to drill down, just to parse/insert all the entries on this page
